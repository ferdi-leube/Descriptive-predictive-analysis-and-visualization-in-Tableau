# Project 6 - Descriptive-predictive-analysis-and-visualization-in-Tableau - 

*Ferdi*
*[DA, Paris & 06/22]*

## Description 

This weeks focus concentrated on data cleaning, preparation and especially on how to display the results of these procedures on Tableau. For this project I have recieved data including information about the different transactions a certain company made to its partners. The information included the different steps (status) of the transactions, the bank, initial amount, charges, date etc.

After cleaning the columns, rearranging the data (e.g. ectracting the country of each bank and transaction partner from Bank reference, converting date to uniform datetime type etc.) and building extra dataframes for more in-detail analysis and forecast model creation I imported all necessary data frames infrom of csv files into my tableau and began with visualizing my results as well as using tableau tools to further analyse and gain insights from my data.

The big conclusion of this piece of work was putting in action my tableau skills and presenting the most interesting inisights and informations about the transactions of the company.
